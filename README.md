# Happy People Do It Better

"Yeah, you can get a lot done in a 40-hour workweek. But imagine how much more you could do with a 90-hour workweek!"

That's the sound of the tech industry buying into the Overkill Cult. And in 2013, Jason Lengstorf was guzzling the Kool-Aid. He was on the computer for 13 hours or more per day, 7 days a week. He was working so much that his health and happiness were noticeably declining.

And he still wasn't "getting ahead" at work.

In 2014 he scaled back drastically, dipping to below 6 hours a day on the computer. Now you might expect that Jason got half the work done with less than half the computer time. But in reality there was absolutely no negative change in his productivity.

There was, however, a huge positive change in his physical and mental condition.

In this talk, Jason will show that the key to sustained productivity and job satisfaction is balance, and that the current pressure to join the Overkill Cult is actually resulting in lower overall productivity and reduced happiness. a balanced schedule a win for employees, employers, freelancers, and families alike.
