            <p>Research has actually shown that workers are <em>more</em> productive when they work from home — not to mention more satisfied with their work and happier overall in their lives. But that’s getting off the point a bit.</p>
            <p>While sometimes it’s just not possible to convince your boss, in most cases you can convince your boss to at least let you try — assuming you've got your bases covered ahead of time. (Which is what we’re going to cover in the rest of this presentation.)</p>

            <p>If we work on a team in an office, there are people around — both managers and coworkers — whose mere presence is a reminder that we’re supposed to be accomplishing things. Coupled with a manager’s role of checking in, we have a huge disincentive to screw around.</p>

            <li class="fragment"><strong>Laser focus.</strong> You’re crystal clear on your priority, and work to create a distraction-free environment where you can focus completely.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Excellent problem-solving skills.</strong> You may not know all the answers, but you <em>do</em> have every confidence that you can figure things out.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Humility.</strong> You don’t need to be the smartest person in the room. If you know someone on the team can help, you ask.</li>

          <h2>Good time management <span class="hugify">isn’t magic.</span></h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Try to work <em>with</em> willpower instead of against it. </strong> Do the most demanding tasks early in the day when you have the most energy.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Make time to plan.</strong> Work backwards from the ideal final product and create steps. Don’t stop until each step is an hour or two long.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Only tackle one major todo per day.</strong> Accomplishing two things is really encouraging if you only plan to do one; it’s crushing if you planned for three.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Staying Focused <em class="hugify">Is Simple.</em> (But not easy.)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Use a timer.</strong> Racing the clock helps keep motivation high, and creates healthy pressure to finish on time.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Go ghost.</strong> When the timer is running, put your phone in airplane mode, close email, and free yourself to focus.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Find your happy place.</strong> Experiment with different environments — coffee shops, home offices, coworking spaces, etc. — until you find what works best for you.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Turning off notifications is <em>really</em> stressful at first. We’ve all been conditioned to use our phones like a morphine drip – cutting off that supply of endorphins is hard to do. But remember: since you’re using a timer, you know you’ll be connected again in a short time.</p>
            <p>Each of us has an optimal working environment. Some people do really well with the murmur of people talking in a coffee shop. Others need the silence of a home office. And others are most productive in a group setting (even — gasp! — an office). We each have to figure out where we work best, and put ourselves there.</p>

            <li class="fragment"><strong>Reach out to clients first.</strong> If a client has to ask what you’re working on, it’s already too late.</li>
          </ol>

            <p>I hate reaching out to clients without something to show them. I want to put it off: “I’ll reach out to them once I get this phase done.”</p>
            <p>The problem is that a few days for me feels like nothing; a few days for a client or manager who’s heard <em>literally</em> nothing from me feels like a lifetime.</p>

          <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Use an #off-topic Slack channel.</strong> Create a space to share GIFs, make jokes, and talk about things that aren’t work-related.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Have friendly video calls.</strong> At least once a month, have a video call with no agenda. Catch up with your team and take time to be friendly.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Create opportunities for in-person meet-ups.</strong> At least once a year try to get the whole team in once place to spend time together.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There’s no water cooler or break room for remote workers, so casual, friendly conversation requires an effort.</p>
            <p>If it’s possible to get together in person for occasional events — like a dinner or drinks — do it.</p>
            <p>This is just as applicable for clients as it is for coworkers. Most of my best clients are also friends in some capacity, and maintaining our friendships helps eliminate some of the awkward tension that could otherwise come up in the course of business. Of course, there aren’t as many opportunities to bring your clients together to hang out, so take advantage of any chance you get to become more than just “the person who deals with angry client emails”.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The trick is to draw attention to your abilities by <em>showing</em> what you can do, rather than <em>telling</em> people.</p>
            <p>When adding extra features, make sure they’re not crazy — you don’t want to set the expectation that you add huge bonuses for free — and never let them hold up the project. Finish it as a launch-ready product, and then pull a new branch and play with extras if there’s time before the deadline.</p>

            <p>When taking tasks, don’t commit to something that you can’t deliver. My rule of thumb is “what I know + 10%”.</p>
            <p>Teach, but don’t condescend. You want to be a resource, not a prick. Remember that while you know more about <em>this</em> topic than someone else, you probably know <em>a whole lot less</em> about many other topics.</p>

          <ul>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Don’t avoid tasks that aren’t strictly “your job”.</strong> If a client needs something done, do it if you can. Doesn’t matter if that’s what they hired you for.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><strong>Offer all the advice you have — for free.</strong> Never work for free, but talk is extremely cheap. Share your expertise with clients and leads and watch the business pile up.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In mafia movies, a “fixer” is the guy who can be relied on to solve problems — <em>no matter what</em> they may be. Bodyguard? No problem. Date for an important person‘s spouse? He’ll get his suit pressed. Hide a body? In the usual spot, or somewhere new?</p>
            <p>If our clients can bring us <em>any</em> problem related to their business, they’ll not only trust us with a huge amount of business, but we’ll have long-lasting trust that creates an intensely valuable referral network.</p>
            <p>Sharing advice is hugely valuable. I will tell you <em>everything I know</em> right now, if you’re willing to sit and listen, because I know that my knowledge is only a part of why I’m valuable. I’m valuable because I can <em>execute</em> on that knowledge, and I have a style that’s uniquely mine. People pay me for execution and style; knowledge is a foregone conclusion. So sure: let me tell you <em>exactly</em> how to solve that problem. Then you can hire me to implement the solution I’ve just handed you.</p>
